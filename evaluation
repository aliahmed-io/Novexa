# Novexa – Honest Project Evaluation

_Last updated: 2025-12-05_

---

## 1. How complete is the website overall?

**Blunt answer:** Functionally, you are around **70–75% of the way to a sellable MVP**, but only **50–60% of the way to a production-ready commercial product** that a non-technical buyer could operate safely.

- **What works end-to-end (if env is configured):**
  - Auth via Kinde.
  - Browsing products with filters/search.
  - Cart backed by Redis.
  - Stripe checkout (session creation, redirect, webhook, payment & order records, success/cancel pages).
  - User order history page.
  - Contact form + admin contact management.
  - Admin dashboard (products, categories, discounts, email broadcast, banner images, orders table, analytics).
  - AI-powered search and ShoeAssistant (Gemini-based), assuming API keys.
  - Basic shipping label purchase flow via Shippo from the admin dashboard.

- **What is still prototype / incomplete / risky:**
  - No real shipping address capture from users; shipping uses **hardcoded demo address**.
  - No Shippo webhook integration, so **shipment status and order status are not truly automated**.
  - No wishlist, no account profile management, no returns/exchanges flow.
  - No tests (unit/E2E), no monitoring, no error tracking, minimal logging.
  - Legal/compliance basics (ToS, Privacy Policy, cookie banner) are missing.
  - Some AI features (3D model generation, TryOnSession) exist in schema but are not wired into a complete UX.

If a serious buyer asked “Can I launch this next week?”, the honest answer is **not without additional work**.

---

## 2. Which features are not fully implemented yet?

### 2.1 Shipping & fulfillment

- **User shipping address:**
  - `User` model has **no address fields** (just name, email, profileImage).
  - `lib/shippo.ts` + `orders/actions.ts` use a **placeholder address** (`"123 Main St", New York, NY 10001`) for the customer side.
  - There is **no UI at checkout to collect real shipping address** or choose shipping options.

- **Shipment automation & tracking:**
  - `Shipment` model exists and `buyShippingLabel` writes tracking number, carrier, label URL, ETA.
  - Order status is set to `shipped` when a label is bought.
  - **Missing:** Shippo webhooks to move `ShipmentStatus` from `PENDING -> SHIPPED -> DELIVERED -> RETURNED` and sync `OrderStatus` accordingly.
  - No customer-facing shipment tracking page; they do not see status beyond “pending/shipped/delivered” in `orders` summary with no item-level detail.

### 2.2 AI / 3D / Try-on

- **3D model generation (Meshy):**
  - There are `generate3DModel` / `delete3DModel` server actions and fields on `Product` (`modelUrl`, `meshyTaskId`, `meshyStatus`, `meshyProgress`).
  - **Missing pieces:**
    - Background polling / webhook from Meshy to update progress and `modelUrl`.
    - Clear admin UX for monitoring per-product generation status.

- **AI virtual try-on (TryOnSession):**
  - `TryOnSession` table exists in Prisma.
  - There is **no visible UI, pages, or actions** implementing user upload and output gallery.
  - This is currently **schema-only**; not a ship-ready feature.

- **AI assistant & AI search:**
  - Implemented with Google Gemini (`/api/assistant`, `/api/search` + `filterProducts`).
  - Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` and model name; if missing, assistant/search fail or fall back.
  - There’s no usage limiting, logging, or fallback messaging beyond basic error handling.

### 2.3 Marketing / CRM

- **Broadcast email system (Resend):**
  - `resend` client is configured with a fallback dummy key (`re_missing_key`) and warns if missing key.
  - Admin broadcast email feature exists with segmentation options but:
    - Newsletter audience logic is left as a **TODO**; currently just fetches all users.
    - No unsubscribe / subscription preference model.
    - Using `onboarding@resend.dev` sender; not ready for a real brand domain.

- **Transactional emails:**
  - Stripe webhook sends an order confirmation email via `Resend` + `OrderConfirmationEmail` **if** `RESEND_API_KEY` is set.
  - No emails for shipping updates, delivery confirmation beyond Stripe payment confirmation.

### 2.4 User account / UX gaps

- **Wishlist / favorites:** Not implemented at all.
- **Profile & addresses:** No page for managing addresses, phone numbers, or saved payment methods.
- **Returns / refunds:** No frontend flows or admin tooling; Stripe refunds would need to be done manually via dashboard with no sync into your DB.
- **Reviews:** CRUD for reviews exists, but there’s no moderation tooling beyond a bad language filter.

### 2.5 Operational / engineering gaps

- **Tests:** 0 visible tests (no Jest/Playwright config, no spec files). Checkout, shipping, and AI flows are **untested** beyond manual testing.
- **Monitoring & logging:** Only basic console logs; no Sentry, no structured logs, no uptime checks.
- **Security hardening:**
  - No explicit rate limiting on `/api/assistant`, `/api/search`, `/api/checkout`, or contact form.
  - No CSRF protections beyond what Next’s patterns implicitly provide.
  - API keys are used directly without per-feature feature-flagging.

## 3. Current website evaluation (high-level)

**Short version:** This is a **visually impressive, technically modern, feature-rich prototype**. It is **not yet an operational e‑commerce business in a box**.

- **Strengths:**
  - Strong visual design with 3D product viewer, polished UI, and modern components.
  - Real Stripe integration, Redis cart, and Prisma/Postgres schema for orders, payments, shipments.
  - Solid admin panel: product, categories, discounts, banners, email broadcasting, orders, contact center.
  - Advanced “nice to have” features: AI assistant, AI-powered search, AI-enriched product metadata, 3D viewer.

- **Weaknesses / risks:**
  - Shipping is only half-implemented: great backend pieces, missing real address capture and automation.
  - No tests or monitoring; a buyer cannot trust that payments & orders won’t silently break.
  - Legal and compliance are missing (ToS/Privacy/Cookies/return policy pages).
  - Documentation is minimal; a non-technical store owner would struggle.

This is **sellable as a “premium prototype / codebase”** right now, but **not sellable as a plug-and-play production store**.

## 4. Ratings (0–10)

### 4.1 Design (UI & visual polish) – **9/10**

- Responsive layouts using Tailwind and modern patterns.
- 3D landing page, Antigravity viewer, and product detail page are visually strong.
- Consistent usage of design system components (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, etc.).
- Small deduction: no clear brand system (typography/spacing docs, design tokens) and some minor naming inconsistencies.

### 4.2 Performance – **8/10** (code-level estimate)

- Uses Next.js App Router, server components, and `noStore` on dynamic server pages to avoid stale data.
- Cart uses Redis (Upstash), which is performant.
- Product listing pages use pagination/limits and local filtering; heavy things like AI ranking are optional.
- Potential issues:
  - AI endpoints can be slow or fail; no graceful degradation beyond a simple error message.
  - Some components may overfetch without aggressive caching or image optimization review.

### 4.3 UX (user journey) – **7/10**

- Core flow **from landing → shop → product → bag → checkout → order history** is coherent.
- Nice touches: custom 404, loading skeletons, AI assistant, search overlay, filters on product listing.
- Missing UX pieces:
  - No clear checkout steps (shipping → payment → review) – it jumps straight from cart to Stripe.
  - No way for users to manage addresses, saved preferences, or notification settings.
  - No visible order detail page (line items, shipping address, tracking link) – only order summary.

### 4.4 User functionality (customer-facing features) – **7/10**

- **Implemented:**
  - Auth, browse, search (standard + AI), filter, sort.
  - View product details, 3D viewer, reviews.
  - Add to cart, discount codes, checkout via Stripe.
  - Contact form, order history.

- **Missing or thin:**
  - Wishlist, recently viewed, recommended products sections.
  - Address book, profile, returns/exchanges flow.
  - Shipment tracking details, tracking link, detailed receipt view.

### 4.5 Admin functionality – **8.5/10**

- **Strong:**
  - Products CRUD with bulk update/delete and status handling.
  - Categories and discounts management.
  - Banner management.
  - Orders table with status editing and integrated shipping label purchase.
  - Contact center with statuses and “Mark as read” tooling.
  - Broadcast email system with basic segmentation UI.
  - Dashboard analytics (revenue chart, recent sales, AI insights widget).

- **Weak:**
  - Newsletter segmentation is faked; no real subscriber model.
  - No admin-facing logs/audit trail (who changed what, when).
  - No configuration UI for keys/integration settings (Stripe, Shippo, Resend, Gemini).

### 4.6 Overall rating – **7.5/10 as a codebase, 6/10 as a product you can sell as-is**

- As a developer-focused asset: **7.5–8/10**.
- As a “turn-key shop for a non-dev store owner”: **6/10** due to missing operational pieces.

## 5. What currently stops you from selling this website as a real store?

Here are the **hard blockers**:

1. **Shipping is not production-grade.**
   - No real address capture or validation at checkout.
   - No shipping method selection by customer.
   - Hardcoded demo addresses in backend.
   - No automated shipment status updates from Shippo.

2. **Legal and policy pages are missing.**
   - No clear Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Returns & Refunds, Shipping policy.
   - No cookie consent / tracking disclosure if you add analytics later.

3. **Monitoring, error tracking, and tests are missing.**
   - If Stripe or Shippo fails, you mostly log to console.
   - No alarms, no E2E tests to protect checkout.

4. **Configuration and documentation are not buyer-friendly.**
   - A non-technical buyer would have to wire up: Kinde, Stripe, Resend, Shippo, Upstash Redis, Postgres (Neon), Gemini, UploadThing.
   - There’s no single deployment guide or env var reference beyond `.env`/`.env.local`.

5. **Security & abuse controls are minimal.**
   - No rate limiting on expensive AI and email endpoints.
   - No brute-force protection on contact form or broadcast email.

Until you address at least shipping, legal pages, and a basic observability/test story, you **should not market this as “ready to run a real store today”**.

## 6. Most important missing features or areas to improve

### 6.1 Shipping & checkout

- Add a **checkout step that collects shipping details** (name, address, phone) and persists them.
- Integrate shipping options (cheapest, fastest, etc.) from Shippo and let the user pick.
- Implement **Shippo webhooks** to update `Shipment` and `Order` statuses.
- Show tracking information (carrier + tracking number + link) on the `My Orders` page.

### 6.2 User account & self-service

- Add a **Profile / Account** page:
  - Manage name, email (with verification flow), profile image.
  - Manage multiple addresses.
- Add **Wishlist / Favorites** so users can save items.
- Add basic **returns / refunds** guidance and at least a manual request form connected to admin.

### 6.3 Admin & operations

- Implement a **NewsletterSubscriber** model or a subscription flag on `User` and wire it into broadcast email.
- Add **audit logs** for critical changes (prices, discounts, email campaigns).
- Add a simple **admin dashboard for integration health** (Stripe/Shippo/Resend/Gemini status checks).

### 6.4 Reliability, tests, and monitoring

- Add **Playwright** E2E tests for:
  - Login, browse, add to cart, apply discount, checkout, webhook, order history.
  - Admin login, products CRUD, shipping label purchase.
- Add **unit tests** for core business logic (discounts, cart operations, filters).
- Integrate **Sentry or similar** for error tracking and a basic uptime check on `/api/health`.

### 6.5 Security & abuse prevention

- Add **rate limiting** to:
  - `/api/assistant`, `/api/search` (AI endpoints).
  - `/api/checkout`.
  - Contact form and broadcast email actions.
- Ensure all API routes validate input and hide internal error details from users.

### 6.6 SEO & marketing polish

- Ensure dynamic `metadata` (title, description, OpenGraph images) on product pages.
- Add structured data (schema.org) for products.
- Flesh out blog/landing content if you want organic traffic.

---

## 7. Other important questions you didn’t ask (and their blunt answers)

### 7.1 Security posture – **Adequate for a prototype, not audited for production**

- Uses Kinde for auth (solid), Stripe for payments (good), and doesn’t handle raw card data.
- However:
  - No formal security review.
  - No clear story around admin account management (right now, hardcoded to one email).
  - No protection against DDoS or abusive API usage.

### 7.2 Scalability

- Tech stack (Next.js + Postgres + Redis + Stripe + Shippo) is **inherently scalable enough** for a typical DTC shoe store.
- Performance will be fine for thousands of users if infra is sized reasonably.
- The bottlenecks will be external APIs (Gemini, Shippo, Resend), not your own code.

### 7.3 Maintainability / code quality

- Code is mostly clean, typed, and componentized.
- Uses server actions and Prisma in a sane way.
- Some duplication and unfinished paths (`checkOut` server action stub, newsletter TODOs) should be cleaned up before a sale.

### 7.4 Deployment readiness

- Next.js project is deployable to Vercel or similar.
- You have multiple third-party services to configure; without a **single deployment playbook**, handover will be painful.

## 8. Recommended next steps before selling

If your goal is to sell this as a **“ready to launch” store**, I would prioritize, in order:

1. **Finish shipping & checkout UX (address capture + Shippo webhooks + tracking in orders).**
2. **Add legal/policy pages and basic SEO/meta improvements.**
3. **Add minimal monitoring (Sentry) and 2–3 Playwright E2E tests around checkout & webhook.**
4. **Tighten email/newsletter logic and remove TODO-level hacks.**
5. **Write a short technical + non-technical README** explaining setup, env vars, and how to operate the store.

Once those are done, you can honestly pitch this as:

> A modern 3D-enabled shoe e‑commerce template with AI assistant, admin dashboard, Stripe payments, and basic shipping integration – ready for customization and real-world use.

## 9. Future AI-native features to build

1. **AI Chief Operating Officer (COO) Mode**
   - Weekly or on-demand report that summarizes growth, bottlenecks, and recommended actions, wired directly into server actions (e.g. create discounts, launch campaigns, adjust operations).
2. **Auto-Generated Campaigns**
   - One-click generation of email campaigns, social captions, and discount ideas using real product and order data, feeding into the existing Resend broadcast/email system for review and send.
3. **AI Flagging System**
   - Continuous monitoring of reviews, orders, payments, traffic, and support tickets to surface suspicious activity and anomalies into an Alerts view in the dashboard.
4. **AI Dressing Room (Virtual Try-On)**
   - Users upload a photo and select a shoe; an external model (e.g. Replicate API / Flux-based VTON) generates an image of them wearing it, storing the output and metadata in `TryOnSession` for later viewing.
